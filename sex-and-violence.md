### Jaywalking: A colorful history

1910s - 1920s: **Scenario**

* Children are getting hit by cars
* Mothers are freaking out

### Jaywalking: A colorful history

Before this time, **people** owned the streets.

We walked there, played there, made it an extension of our property.

So when cars came by, we didn't move.

### Jaywalking: Early Days

**PEDESTRIANS**

* *Get out of here ya damn joyriders!*

### Jaywalking: Darwinism

The roads became *survival of the fittest*.

> Pedestrians (and bicyclists) cited custom to claim prior rights,
> but custom could rarely withstand motoristsâ€™ superior power and speed.

As motorists found out, engines weren't enough.

> To secure an urban future for the car, they would have to win a legitimate
> place for it in the street and cast doubt on the legitimacy of those who
> stood in the way.

### Jaywalking: Resistance is Futile

**SPEED LIMITS**

Low speed limits were near impossible to enforce.

**GOVERNORS**

25mph - engine shuts off. Voters didn't like the idea.

**MORE VISIBLE TRAFFIC LINES/SIGNS**

No one cared.

### Jaywalking: Resistance is Futile
